# AoC2017

AoC2017 is an R package solver for Advent of Code 2017.

## Installation

You can install the released version of AoC2017 from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("danhalligan/AoC2017")
```

## Example

To solve a specific day, you can use `solve_day`, passing in the input for
the current day.


``` r
library(AoC2017)
solve_day(day = 1, file = "day1-input.txt")
solve_day(file = "day1-input.txt")
```

If day is not provided it is guessed from the filename.

``` r
solve_day(file = "day1-input.txt")
```

Alternatively, some questions only require a short integer to be provided as
input:

```{r}
library(AoC2017)
solve_day(day = 3, input = 1024)
```
